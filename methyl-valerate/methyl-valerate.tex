    Methyl valerate (\ce{C6H12O2}, methyl pentanoate) is a methyl ester and a
    relevant surrogate component for biodiesel. In this work, we present
    ignition delays of methyl valerate measured using a rapid compression
    machine at a range of engine-relevant temperature, pressure, and equivalence
    ratio conditions. The conditions we have studied include equivalence ratios
    from \numrange{0.25}{2.0}, temperatures between \SIlist{600;1100}{\K}, and
    pressures of \SIlist{15;30}{\bar}. The ignition delay data demonstrate a
    negative temperature coefficient region and two-stage ignition response in
    the temperature range of \SIrange[range-phrase={--}]{700}{800}{\K} for the
    equivalence ratios of \numlist{1.0;2.0} and pressure of \SI{30}{\bar}. In
    addition, the experimental ignition delay data are compared with simulations
    using an existing chemical kinetic model from the literature. The
    simulations with the literature model underpredict the data by factors
    between \numlist{2;10} over the entire range of the experimental data. To
    help determine the possible reasons for the discrepancy between simulations
    and experiments, a new chemical kinetic model is developed using the
    Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software. The agreement between the
    experimental data and the RMG model is improved but still not satisfactory.
    Directions for future improvement of the methyl valerate models are
    discussed.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

For transportation applications, biodiesel is an important constituent in
improving environmental friendliness of fuels, due to its renewability when
produced from sustainable agricultural crops and its ability to reduce emissions
relative to conventionally fueled engines \autocite{Hoekman2012}. A recent
review paper summarizes the recent work on methyl esters relevant to biodiesel
combustion \autocite{Coniglio2013}. Autoignition of methyl butanoate (MB,
\ce{C5H10O2}) has been well-studied in both shock tube and rapid compression
machine experiments, and readers are referred to the review of
\textcite{Coniglio2013} for further details. The prevalance of MB data in the
literature is largely due to the early identification of MB as a potential
surrogate fuel for biodiesel \autocite{Fisher2000}. However, the experiments
have shown that MB may not be an appropriate surrogate for biodiesel, due to its
lack of NTC behavior, a requirement for a suitable biodiesel surrogate
\autocite{Coniglio2013}.

Larger methyl esters such as methyl valerate (MV, \ce{C6H12O2}, methyl
pentanoate) have also been studied as possible biodiesel surrogates.
\textcite{Hadj-Ali2009} used a rapid compression machine to study the
autoignition of several methyl esters including MV. Although MV exhibited
two-stage ignition in this study, little additional research has been done on
its oxidation. \textcite{Korobeinichev2015} studied MV in premixed laminar
flames and extended a detailed high temperature chemical kinetic mechanism to
include the two fuels. \textcite{Dmitriev2015} added MV to n-heptane/toluene
fuel blends to determine the resulting intermediate species in premixed flames
using a flat burner at \SI{1}{atm} and an equivalence ratio of 1.75. The
addition of MV helped reduce soot forming intermediates including benzene,
cyclopentadienyl, acetylene, propargyl, and vinylacetylene. \textcite{Hayes2009}
computationally examined the peroxy radical isomerization reactions for MV to
better understand the low temperature reaction pathways. \textcite{Dievart2013}
used diffusion flames in the counterflow configuration to determine extinction
limits for a number of methyl esters, and validated several kinetic models with
the experimental data

This work provides additional data for the autoignition of MV. Data is collected
in a rapid compression machine (RCM) under engine relevant conditions spanning
from \SIrange{15}{30}{\bar}, equivalence ratios from \numrange{0.25}{2.0}, and
temperatures from \SIrange{682}{1048}{\K}. The NTC region of MV is mapped out to
provide additional information on the fidelity of using MV as a biodiesel
surrogate.

\section{Experimental Methods}\label{sec:experimental-methods}

The RCM used in this study is a single piston arrangement and is pneumatically
driven and hydraulically stopped. The device has been described in detail
previously \autocite{Mittal2007a} and will be described here briefly for
reference. The end of compression (EOC) temperature and pressure (\(T_C\) and
\(P_C\) respectively), are independently changed by varying the overall
compression ratio, initial pressure, and initial temperature of the experiments.
The primary diagnostic on the RCM is the in-cylinder pressure. The pressure data
is processed by a Python package called UConnRCMPy \autocite{uconnrcmpy}, which
calculates \(P_C\), \(T_C\), and the ignition delay(s). The definition of the
ignition delay is shown in \cref{fig:ign-delay-def}. The time of the EOC is
defined as the maximum of the pressure trace prior to the start of ignition and
the ignition delays are defined as the time from the EOC until local maxima in
the first time derivative of the pressure.

In addition to the reactive experiments, non-reactive experiments are conducted
to determine the influence of machine-specific behavior on the experimental
conditions and permit the calculation of the EOC temperature via the isentropic
relations between pressure and temperature \autocite{Lee1998}. The EOC
temperature is calculated by the procedure described in
\cref{sec:computational-methods}.

The mixtures considered in this study are shown in \cref{tab:mixtures}. Mixtures
are prepared in stainless steel mixing tanks. The proportions of reactants in
the mixture are determined by specifying the absolute mass of the fuel, the
equivalence ratio, and the ratio of \(\ce{Ar}:\ce{N2}\) in the oxidizer. Since
MV is a liquid with a relatively small vapor pressure at room temperature and
pressure, it is injected into the mixing tank through a septum. Proportions of
\ce{O2}, \ce{Ar}, and \ce{N2} are added manometrically at room temperature.

The RCM is equipped with heaters to control the initial temperature of the
mixture. After filling in the components to the mixing tanks, the heaters are
switched on and the system is allowed \SI{1.5}{\hour} to come to steady state.
The mixing tanks are also equipped with magnetic stir bars to the reactants are
well mixed for the duration of the experiments.

The initial temperature is chosen such that the vapor pressure of the fuel at
the initial temperature is at least twice the partial pressure of the fuel in
the mixing tank. The Antoine equation
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:antoine}
    \logten{P_{\text{sat}}} = A - \frac{B}{T - C}
\end{equation}
%
is used to model the vapor pressure of MV as a function of temperature, where
\(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are substance-specific coefficients and
\(P_{\text{sat}}\) is the vapor pressure. The coefficients in \cref{eq:antoine}
are determined by least squares fitting of the data of \textcite{Ortega2003},
\textcite{vanGenderen2002}, and \textcite{Verevkin2008} using the
\verb|curve_fit()| function of SciPy \autocite{Jones2001} version 0.18.1.
\Cref{fig:vapor-pressure} shows that the coefficients fit with this procedure
give good agreement with the experimental data.

\section{Computational Methods}\label{sec:computational-methods}
\subsection{Experimental Modeling}\label{sec:experimental-modeling}

The Python 3.5 interface of Cantera \autocite{cantera} version 2.2.1 is used for
all simulations in this work. Detailed descriptions of the use of Cantera for
these simulations can be found in the work of \textcite{Weber2016a} and
\textcite{Dames2016}; a brief overview is given here. As mentioned in
\cref{sec:experimental-methods}, non-reactive experiments are conducted to
characterize the machine-specific effects on the experimental conditions in the
RCM. This pressure trace is used to compute a volume trace by assuming that the
reactants undergo a reversible, adiabatic, constant composition (i.e.,
isentropic) compression during the compression stroke and an isentropic
expansion after the EOC. The volume trace is applied to a simulation conducted
in an \verb|IdealGasReactor| in Cantera \autocite{cantera} using the CVODES
solver from the SUNDIALS suite \autocite{Hindmarsh2005}. The ignition delay from
the simulations is defined in the same manner as in the experiments. The time
derivative of the pressure in the simulations was computed by second order
Lagrange polynomials, as discussed by \textcite{Chapra2010}.

To the best of our knowledge, there are three mechanisms for MV combustion
available in the literature. The first two, by \textcite{Dmitriev2015} and
\textcite{Korobeinichev2015} were developed to simulate flames, and do not
include the low-temperature chemistry necessary to simulate the conditions in
these experiments. The third model was developed by \textcite{Dievart2013} and
includes low-temperature chemistry of MV.
% To use this mechanism in Cantera, we
% made a number of modifications, including removing duplicate species from the
% thermodynamic database and removing the excited \ce{OH*} and \ce{CH*} chemistry,
% which is not supported by Cantera 2.2.1. For most of the duplicate species in
% the thermodynamic database, the thermodynamic data is identical, so one copy of
% the duplicate species is simply removed from the database. However, some species
% are not exact duplicates. For these species, it is not clear from the
% thermodynamic database file which data set should be preferred and the default
% of Cantera (and CHEMKIN) to choose the first instance of a duplicate species is
% used.
The detailed \textcite{Dievart2013} model includes 1103 species and 7557
reactions.

\subsection{Reaction Mechanism Generator}\label{sec:reaction-mechanism-generator}

In addition to using mechanisms from the literature, we investigate the use of
an automatic mechanism generator, the open-source Reaction Mechanism Generator
(RMG) \autocite{Allen2012} version 1.0.4. The Python version of RMG is used,
which requires Python 2.7, and version 1.10.0 of the RMG database is used. The
final RMG model contains 483 species and 19990 reactions. Note that the number
of species is much lower than the \textcite{Dievart2013} model because the RMG
model focuses on only one fuel (MV), but the number of reactions is
substantially higher.

\section{Experimental Results}\label{sec:experimental-results}

\Cref{fig:ignition-delays} shows the ignition delay results measured in this
study. Filled markers denote the overall ignition delay and hollow markers
indicate the first-stage ignition delay. The uncertainty in the ignition delay
can be estimated as the vertical size of the data points, while horizontal error
bars are shown on the first and last point of each equivalence ratio indicating
the estimated uncertainty in the EOC temperature of $\pm\SI{1}{\percent}$
\cite{Weber2015}. \cref{fig:ignition-delays}a shows the results for a compressed
pressure of \SI{15}{\bar}, while \cref{fig:ignition-delays}b shows the results
for a compressed pressure of \SI{30}{\bar}. Note that $\phi=2.0$ results were
not collected for \SI{30}{\bar}, so there are no red data points in
\cref{fig:ignition-delays}b.

It can be seen from \cref{fig:ignition-delays} that the ignition delays for the
$\phi=\numlist{0.25;0.5}$ mixtures do not show an NTC region of the ignition
delay for both of the pressures studied in this work. However, the $\phi=1.0$
mixture shows an NTC region at $P_C=\SI{30}{\bar}$ between approximately
\SIlist{720;800}{\K}, with measured first-stage ignition delays at
\SIlist{734;757}{\K}. In addition, the $\phi=2.0$ mixture shows an NTC region of
ignition delay at \SI{15}{\bar} from approximately \SIrange{720}{775}{\K}, with
measured first-stage ignition delays between \SIlist{720;750}{\K}.
